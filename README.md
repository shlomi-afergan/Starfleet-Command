## Starfleet Command - Java Implementation:

In this exercise, a software system was built to manage a futuristic spacecraft fleet. Initially, classes were built to represent the crew members and the various types of spacecraft using weapons, abstract classes, and inheritance. After that, objects of these classes were created, and a series of reports were generated displaying various pieces of information about our fleet of spaceships, such as total maintenance costs, total firepower of the fleet's spaceships, and more.
